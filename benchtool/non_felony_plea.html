                    <strong>Note:</strong> In recognition of the high volume of pleas to non-felony offenses which may be required to be taken on a given day in a local criminal court, the following questions extracted from the recommended plea colloquy provide, in the discretion of the court, a shorter, albeit sufficient, plea colloquy. However, even for a non-felony offense, the expanded colloquy or parts thereof may be appropriate. Sentences in brackets are recommended but not required by law.

                        The specification of the rights included within the waiver of the right to a trial are derived from <em>Boykin v. Alabama , 395 U.S. 238 (1969)</em>. The Court of Appeals has held that the failure to recite those rights in haec verba will not render the plea invalid if "record as a whole affirmatively shows that the defendant intentionally relinquished those rights." See cases cited in note 1. Needless to add, it is best to advise the defendant expressly of the rights waived both for the defendant's benefit and to avoid necessitating an appellate court having to search the record to determine whether the defendant somehow intentionally waive those rights. <a href="#fnref2-abbrev" class="footnote-backref" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a>
